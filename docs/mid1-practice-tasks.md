# Practice Tasks for Mid-1

## Task-01

1. Create a directory structure for a project named "BharatApp", with subdirectories for "Documents", "Scripts", and "Logs". Then, create an empty file named "README.txt" in the project's root directory.

2. In the "Scripts" directory of "BharatApp", create a script file named "init.sh". Add a line of text in this file that says "Initialization script for BharatApp". Then, display the contents of this file.

3. Inside the "Documents" directory of "BharatApp", create a file named "project_overview.txt". Write a brief description of the project in this file. Afterwards, list all the files in the "Documents" directory.

## Task-02
In your home directory, create a directory named "BharatProject". Inside it, create two subdirectories named "Reports" and "Resources". Within "Reports", create an empty file named "summary.txt". Use the `echo` command to add a line of text "Project Summary" into "summary.txt". Finally, use `cat` to display the contents of "summary.txt", and then use `ls` to list all files in the "Reports" directory.

## Task-03
Create a directory named "BharatAnalysis" in your current working directory. Inside "BharatAnalysis", create three subdirectories: "Data", "Scripts", and "Results". In the "Scripts" directory, create a file named "run_analysis.sh" and write "Echo Running Analysis Script" into it. Then, use the `cat` command to display the contents of "run_analysis.sh", and finish by listing the contents of the entire "BharatAnalysis" directory.

## Task-04
In your current directory, create a directory named "TeamBharat". Within "TeamBharat", create two subdirectories: "Meetings" and "Projects". Inside the "Meetings" directory, create a file named "agenda.txt" and use the `echo` command to add the text "Weekly Meeting Agenda" into it. Finally, list the contents of the "Meetings" directory and use `pwd` to display the full path of your current working directory.

## Task-05
Create a directory called "BharatResearch" in the current directory. Inside "BharatResearch", create two subdirectories: "Experiments" and "Notes". In the "Notes" directory, create a file named "ideas.txt" and use `echo` to add the text "Initial Research Ideas" into it. Then, display the contents of "ideas.txt" and list all the files in the "Notes" directory.

## Task-06
In your home directory, create a new directory named "BharatWorkshop". Inside "BharatWorkshop", create three subdirectories: "Designs", "Plans", and "Reviews". In the "Designs" directory, create a file named "blueprint.txt" and use the `echo` command to add "Initial Design Blueprint" into it. After that, list the contents of the "Designs" directory and use `pwd` to display the current directory's path.

## Task-07
In your Week09 directory, create a new directory named "WebApp" in the current directory. Inside "WebApp", create four subdirectories: "HTML", "CSS", "Scripts", and "Assets". 

1. In the "HTML" directory, use `touch` to create three files: "index.html", "about.html", and "contact.html".
2. In the "CSS" directory, create two files: "styles.css" and "layout.css".
3. Navigate to the "Scripts" directory using `cd` and use `touch` to create three files: "app.js", "utils.js", and "api.js".
4. In the "Assets" directory, create two files: "logo.png" and "banner.jpg" using `touch`.
5. Navigate back to the "WebApp" root directory and list all contents of each subdirectory individually.

This expanded task involves creating a more complex directory and file structure, mimicking a real-world web application project layout.

## Task-08

1. In your week09 directory, create a new directory named "BharatHealthApp". Inside "BharatHealthApp", create three subdirectories: "App", "Docs", and "Tests".

2. Inside the "App" directory, create two subdirectories: "Src" and "Assets".
   - In "Src", use `touch` to create "main.js" and "helpers.js". Use `echo` to add a simple comment in each file, such as "Main application logic" in "main.js".
   - In "Assets", create "logo.png" and "icons.png" using `touch`.

3. In the "Docs" directory, create two files with `touch`: "README.md" and "SetupGuide.md". Use `echo` to add a brief project description to "README.md" and basic setup instructions in "SetupGuide.md".

4. Inside the "Tests" directory, create two files: "appTest.js" and "apiTest.js" using `touch`. Add a comment like "App tests" in "appTest.js" using `echo`.
